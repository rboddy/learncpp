## Learn CPP

These are my notes and examples from [LearnCPP](https://learncpp.com). I've been taking a bit of time to learn C++ better, because my fundamentals were lacking and I want to use the language to create games. I'm still deciding between Flax Engine and Unreal Engine. Both have their tradeoffs. So you may see a lesson in here and think "he doesn't need that for unreal", but I may need it for Flax. I'm also generally interested in graphics programming, so I may do something with opengl next. It all depends on what I decide to focus on.

Note: I am treating learncpp as a textbook, so I will be referring to it as a book moving forward.

### Repo Structure

This repo contains many directories, each numbered in the order they are presented in the book. However, the lesson numbers I use do not match up with the book's lesson numbers. Some lessons contained multiple topics that needed directories. Other lessons were either all reading, or skipped altogether. For example, my examples do not include much about bit manipulation or operator overriding. While I have the basic concepts for these, I want to focus my time on topics that are more important to game development. If I need to cover these topics in the future, I'll have a special directory for revisiting concepts.

### My Thoughts on the Book

The book itself is spectacular. It has taught me so much, not just about C++, but about core programming fundamentals that you don't think about when you're slanging JavaScript. I highly encourage anyone to spend time learning with this resource. This repo also contains a javascript snippet you can run in the console with your current lesson number to check your progress. The book is long, so this helps me stay motivated.
