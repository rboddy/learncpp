"Prefer composition over inheritance" - Some really smart individual

This lesson is all about composition in C++. I am very familiar with the concepts of composition because it is how most modern web development frameworks are designed, and it's how Godot, my favorite game engine encourages developers to build games.

Composition is the concept that objects are built from smaller objects. In this lesson, I will show an example of how we can use composition to set the location of a creature in a game.
